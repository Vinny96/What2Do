First thing to do is to is to set up the Category view controller and get that to persist. Completed
We need to implement the swipe functionality. Completed
Colour functionality for category cells. Completed
Colour funcationality for nav bar. Completed
We need to create a date picker for the cells that have an expiry date.  COMPLETED
Now we need to set the categories to have an expiry date and send a push notification.We need to write code that will create a scheduled notification from firebase.  HALF DONE


It is also best to set a small reminder 15 minutes before the alloted time as well. This is to let the user know that their event is coming up so they can start preparing for it. 
Figure out a way to link it to calendar.

One thing that we can do is for first time users of the app we can have a little tutorial that will display. How we can check if they are first time users is we can have a has launched option and persist that. If that number is below 1 as it will be for new users we show the tutoria. Once we have shown the tutorial we can increment that number to two so the tutorial will not trigger. 

In order to schedule the push notification for the reminder it seems that cloud functions are the key to getting this done.

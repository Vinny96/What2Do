# What2Do
A colourful twist on a to do list app with subtle local notifications. APNS is used to deliver local notifications and CoreData is used to persist the cateogry objects, the item objects, the colour associated with the category object and the reminder date. Please note that we do not collect any data from our users. We only ask for permission to send notifications as we would like to remind you of your Task in a clean and subtle way. For any questions or concerns please send an eamil to vinnymadeapps@gmail.com.
